## Quotes

> A little learning is a dangerous thing; **Drink deep**, or taste not the Pierian
> spring.
>
> Alexander Pope

> "Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught
> how not to. So it is with the great programmers". Perlis is saying that the
> greats have some internal quality that transcends their training. But where
> does the quality come from? Is it innate? Or do they develop it through
> diligence? As Auguste Gusteau (the fictional chef in Ratatouille) puts it,
> **"anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great."** I think of it more as
> willingness to devote a large portion of one's life to deliberative practice.
> But maybe fearless is a way to summarize that. Or, as Gusteau's critic, Anton
> Ego, says: "Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can
> come from anywhere."

> Just because you know a statement and proof of Fundamental Lemma X, you
> shouldn’t take that lemma for granted; instead, you should **dig deeper until
> you really understand what the lemma is all about.**

> One needs to do a serious amount of reading and writing, and not just
> thinking, in order to get anywhere serious in mathematics; contrary to public
> opinion, mathematical breakthroughs are not powered solely (or even
> primarily) by “Eureka” moments of genius, but are in fact **largely a product
> of hard work, directed of course by experience and intuition.**
>
> [Work hard](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/work-hard/)

> If you concentrate solely on your career, you can get a long way in your
> career. That’s a strategy that a minority of men preferably do. They work
> 70-80 hours a week. They go flat our on their careers. They’re staking
> everything on small probabilities of exceptional status in a narrow domain.
> It’s hard on them. They don’t have a life. It’s very difficult for them to
> have a family. They don’t know how to take any leisure activities. They get
> very one dimension. It means that the **uni-dimensional is the price you have
> to pay to be exceptional at one thing.** Because if you’re gonna at a level of
> a genius mathematician, you’re in a lab all the time, you work 80 hours a
> week. You’re smart. You’re dedicated. That’s how you get to beat every other
> people who doing that. That’s the only way. It’s a risky business. You
> scarify a lot for it. 
>
> Most people wound’t do it. They wouldn’t put in 80 hours per week that I have
> to put in order to dominate that particular area. The reason they decide not
> to do it is because they think it’s not worth it. No wonder. Because **why
> would that be worth it?** You have to ask yourself that. Why do you want to be
> an outstanding scientist? Ok. Really, that’s what you want. Because that’s
> what you do. You’re competing with other people. They’re smart. They’re
> hardworking. If you want to be at the top, you have to be smarter and work
> harder than any of them. If I am smart and hardworking and I crank out for 80
> hours a week and you do it for 30. In 2 years, I’m so ahead of you. You will
> never ever catch up.
